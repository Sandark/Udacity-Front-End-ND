                    <p class="blogpost_content">
                        It's widely known that cats are so adorable when they are young. They are so pleasant with their
                        <a href="big_head.html">big heads</a> and large eyes. And adult cats also realize that kittens
                        are harmless and deserve to be cherished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here I've collected several reasons why cats are so cute:
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blogpost_paragraph_title">1. Cats are all over</h3>
                    <p class="blogpost_content">
                        Everyone knows that it's hard not to meet cats in the Internet. By statistics pet owners prefer
                        cats over dogs and other pets.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blogpost_paragraph_title">2. Communication with people</h3>
                    <p class="blogpost_content">
                        Usually cats don't mew at other cats. This cute way of communication is reserved only for
                        humans. This is sweet because cats know more than 100 vocal sounds while dogs can make only
                        around 10.

                    <div class="blogpost_paragraph_image left_aligned">
                        <img src="../img/cat_nose.jpg" alt="cat's nose" id="cat-nose" class="image_small">
                        <label for="cat-nose">Cute nose</label>

                    <p class="blogpost_content right_text">
                        Cats also have a "fingerprint". Cat's nose is rigged with with unique pattern. If you have
                        multiple cats, try to compare them!
                    </p>

                        article</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blogpost_paragraph_title">4. Cats love sleeping</h3>
                    <p class="blogpost_content">
                        Just as much as we do. But unlike humans, cats spend an average of two thirds of their day
                        sleeping. One reason that kittens sleep so much is because a growth hormone is released only
                        when theyâ€™re napping.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="blogpost_paragraph_title">5. Cats have awesome nightvision</h3>
                    <div class="blogpost_paragraph_image right_aligned">
                        <img src="../img/cat_night.jpg" alt="cat's eyes" id="night-vision" class="image_small">
                        <label for="night-vision">Cat's eyes</label>
                    </div>
                    <p class="blogpost_content left_text">
                        Cats can't see fine detail or rich color, but have a superior ability to see in the dark because
                        of the high number of rods in their retina that are sensitive to dim light. As a result, cats
                        can see using roughly one-sixth the amount light that people need.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's awesome how great cats are. But don't forget that the most important is to show your pet
                        love and care!
